= HOW CAN FULLY FUNCTIONAL STORES BE BUILT WITH ONLY ONE FREE PLUGIN? =

Prodigy’s solution eliminates the complexity, security risks, and costs of WooCommerce’s plugin and extension architecture by tightly integrating all essential functionality, and natively building premium features, into the platform. [Integration partners](https://prodigycommerce.com/integrations/) include [ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/), [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/), [MaxMind minFraud](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services), a handful of high-quality payment processors, [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), and [Facebook Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel). Natively built premium features currently include abandoned cart recovery and the ability to sell products and services on a subscription basis. No third-party services are needed to build fully functional stores.

= WHY IS THE HOSTED PLATFORM FREE AT ANY SCALE? =

Prodigy’s business model is based solely upon revenue sharing agreements with the payment processors integrated into its platform, similar to Shopify’s exclusive relationship with payments’ facilitator Stripe. Prodigy, however, does not charge a subscription or app fees; it really is [free](https://prodigycommerce.com/why-free/) for the professionals who build stores and their store owner clients. There are no limits on the number of products, orders processed, sales generated, bandwidth or storage used, staff seats, or API requests. Payment processing rates start at the standard 2.9% + $0.30. For high-volume stores, Prodigy helps store owners negotiate lower rates and fees. Prodigy is perfectly aligned with a store owner’s primary goal, generating sales.

= SOLID INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY =

Prodigy’s platform is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and the checkout is [PCI-compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). WordPress is self-hosted; however, Prodigy provides every store with a free SSL/TLS certificate. The combination of one plugin and a hosted platform not only reduces the complexity of building stores and their ongoing maintenance but also maximizes site speed and security.

= COMPLETE STOREFRONT DESIGN FLEXIBILITY =

Prodigy’s plugin was built using WordPress conventions and standards. The templates can be overridden to create unique designs or popular themes and page builders, like [Elementor](https://elementor.com/) Pro, can be used.

= SHOPIFY-LIKE BACKEND EXPERIENCE =

Store owners manage their product catalog and daily [orders](https://prodigycommerce.com/order-management/) on the platform, which is beautifully designed, intuitive, and easy to work with. WordPress is only used for its strengths: managing content and creating the storefront.

= MULTI-CHANNEL CUSTOMER SUPPORT =

Prodigy provides free phone, email, and online chat support from California for the WordPress community of developers, designers, and agencies and their store owner clients. Prodigy is the opposite of WooCommerce, never hiding behind a support forum and pretending that’s customer service. The Prodigy team wants to communicate with, and proactively respond to any feedback received from, the members of the WordPress community and their store owner clients so that the solution can be continuously improved. Of course, a support forum is available via this plugin page and DIY support can be found via the [help center documentation](https://support.prodigycommerce.com/hc/en-us) on Prodigy’s website.

= A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO SHOPIFY AND BIGCOMMERCE TOO =

The WordPress community of developers, designers, and agencies now have a credible alternative to Shopify and BigCommerce since Prodigy is also a hosted solution but with a unique business model (free). Prodigy’s platform is entirely merchant branded as soon as a store logo is uploaded, providing full control over the look-and-feel so that your store owner clients’ customers have a seamless shopping experience from start to finish. Prodigy always prioritize the store owner’s brand over its own.

= YOUR CLIENTS OWN AND CONTROL THEIR STORE DATA =

It should go without saying, but a store owner’s data is their property. If a store owner wishes to migrate to a different platform, they can use the Prodigy product export tool and the Prodigy team will help them export all of their other content free-of-charge.

= PARTNER WITH PRODIGY =

Become a [Prodigy partner](https://prodigycommerce.com/partners/) so that you can influence our development roadmap, share your client’ pain points, and learn about financial incentives.

= PRODIGY’S PLUGIN FEATURES IN A NUTSHELL =

Prodigy's plugin allows you to synchronize the product catalog from the Prodigy platform to the WordPress frontend and customize the storefront using WordPress conventions and standards.

* Synchronizes an unlimited number of products from the Prodigy platform as a custom post type
* Synchronizes product categories and tags from the Prodigy platform as custom taxonomies
* New and updated products are automatically synchronized when the site is on an accessible production server (manual sync available for development environments)
* Templates for catalog pages, product detail pages, and cart page that you can easily override and customize to meet your client’s needs
* Use popular page builders, like [Elementor](https://elementor.com/) Pro. Prodigy’s Elementor Pro integration contains a myriad of powerful Elementor widgets, and Elementor page templates, with conditions for displaying them in specific places. It has more features and widgets than what’s offered in the WooCommerce Elementor plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find Prodigy Commerce documentation and user guides? =

Please visit our [Help Center](https://support.prodigycommerce.com/hc/en-us). If you have any questions, please [contact us](https://prodigycommerce.com/contact/) via phone, email, or initiate an online chat.

= Does Prodigy Commerce use or sell store owner or their customer’s data in any way? =

No.

= Does Prodigy Commerce compete with WordPress developers, designers, or agencies? =

No, we provide software, not services. The only way to build a store with Prodigy is to connect our platform to WordPress with this plugin; we do not have a DIY portal with storefront themes. We only interact with your clients to help them set up their merchant accounts and answer any questions they may have about the day-to-day management of their stores. If one of your clients asks us about website development, design, or digital marketing, we refer them back to you.

= Do WordPress developers, designers, and agencies have an ongoing role after a store is up-and-running on Prodigy? =

Yes, WordPress needs to be hosted, maintained, and updated just like any website. In addition, as we add more features and functionality to our platform and plugin, store owners may need your development and/or design assistance with activation, setup, and implementation.

= Why does Prodigy Commerce focus exclusively on WordPress? =

Because over 40% of all websites run on WordPress. Entrepreneurs love using it for blogging and content creation and the WordPress community love helping them develop/design custom marketing and eCommerce sites.

= What sets Prodigy apart from WooCommerce? =

There are three main things that set Prodigy apart from WooCommerce. You only need ONE free open-source plugin to build beautiful, secure, fully functional stores. Prodigy’s hosted platform is free at any scale and provides your store owner clients with a Shopify-like experience. Prodigy provides free multi-channel customer support (phone, email, and online chat) from California for the WordPress community of developers, designer, and agencies and their store owner clients.
